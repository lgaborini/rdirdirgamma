# rdirdirgamma 0.1.999 (unreleased)

* Adding more C++ functions to compute distances between two datasets.
* Adding functions:
   - `colsd`
   - `norm_minkowski`
   - `compute_distances_gen_obs_cpp`
* Drafting tests for ABC, misc functions.
* Now ABC generates datasets with the same number of rows as the observed dataset.   
  Sampling and distance calculation functions are unchanged, however.
* Documented RNG seed for R and GSL.

* Removed `sample_ABC_rdirdirgamma_cpp`.


# rdirdirgamma 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
