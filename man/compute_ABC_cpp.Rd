\arguments{
\item{n_sample}{hyperparameters that are used to generate data}

\item{m_sample}{hyperparameters that are used to generate data}

\item{alpha_0}{hyperparameters that are used to generate data}

\item{beta_0}{hyperparameters that are used to generate data}

\item{nu_0}{hyperparameters that are used to generate data}

\item{mtx_obs}{observed data}

\item{summarize_eps}{ABC thresholds: as many as summary statistics}

\item{max_iter}{how many iterations are tried}

\item{p_norm}{exponent of the L^p norm (can be `Inf`)}

\item{use_optimized_summary}{if TRUE, return the optimized summary statistics, else standard (mean, sd)}

\item{return_distances}{if TRUE, also return distances for all samples}
}
\value{
if `return_distances` is FALSE, a list with the acceptance ratio, where 1 means that all max_iter samples were accepted.
if `return_distances` is TRUE, a list, with components `d_ABC` (a max_iter x n_summary matrix) and the acceptance ratio
}
